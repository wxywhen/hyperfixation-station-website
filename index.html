          <b>About:</b><br>
          "The Apothecary Diaries" is set in an ancient Imperial China background. It follows Maomao, a young apothecary kidnapped and sold to the Imperial Palace, where she uses her knowledge to solve medical mysteries and intrigue, ultimately drawing the attention of a powerful eunuch and becoming involved in the palace's secrets.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Why You Should Watch:</b><br>
          The mysteries in this show are unpredictable, yet very logical when they are revealed. With episodes that are seemingly separate stories, we later find out that they are all connected to a bigger storyline. Not to mention, Maomao is one of the greatest female protagonists of all time. We always look forward to what her crazy obsession to medicine and curiosity will lead her to next! (p.s its always funny to see Maomao’s obliviousness towards a certain someone’s feelings towards her)
